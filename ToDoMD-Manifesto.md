A todo can have a set off attrbutes:

x +- A status
(++,+,,-) importance
\+ A responsible
? A name
% A description
^ A parent
@ Context
\# A Tag
: A due date

All these properties can be assigned to a todo, but they do not have to be assigned. 
Lets look at the components in detail.

# ? A Name
A minimal todo just needs a name.
You could argue, that a description would suffice. And you were not wrong. But then, how do you referr to that todo? By its description! So the description becomes the name.

# A Status

A todo can be open ( ), it can be done (+), but what else can it be?
It could be failed (x), either by missing the deadline, or by other conditions rendering it non viable.
Or it could be in progress (-). Why should in progress be a condition? If you are like me you start a lot of things, and often you dont finish them. Picture a lazy saturday morning, you dont know what todo. Wouldnt it be nice, to look at your pile of shame and see if you would like to pick up something you left open? I would definetly like to do that some day.

# The importance
We probably all have heard about sorting todos into the for categories:
Important and Urgent, Important and not Urgent, Urgent but not important, and neither.
Your todos should support that, so we add importance to our todos. 
++: very important, should not be failed under any circumstance
+: important, you really should do it
 : not important, not unimportant, but doing it would be kinda nice. Great for if you have some time and dont want to work on the important things.
-: Not important at all. This are the todos you do if you want to procrastinate really hard, or your todo list is otherwise empty. Not like that ever happened to someone.

# A responsible
Normaly that would be you. But just sometimes, you might ask a collegue to do something for you, or a boss delegates your todo to a co-worker. Better write that down, or it will soon be forgotten and things never get done.

# A description
If the name does not suffice, you can add additional context here. Sometimes that is helpfull, sometimes its not.

# A parent
Believe it or not, but sometimes your todos might depend on each other.You cant empty the dishwasher, before you filled it.
Tracking these dependencies might be nice.

# The context
Everything has context. Here i want to add context to my todos, espacially context of where it has to be done.
@Lab contextualizes everything i want to do in the lab. So when i actually am in the lab, i can filter for @Lab and fidn all teh things i want todo there.

# A Tag
I use tags to contextualize my files within projects. I thing you should be able do the same with todos. Again, no preasure, you dont have to. But you can.

# A due date
Some of your todos have to be done by a certain date, and if they have to be, better write that down.

# What about urgency?
You may have picked up erarlier, that importance and urgency give a phase space for todos, so why dont i have urgency in my todo? There is, its called a due date. If that is in 3 months, no worries, its not urgent. If it is tomorrow, you better hurry. Is it yesterday? You failed, i am sorry.

# And whats with duration?
Have your duration estimates ever worked out?
