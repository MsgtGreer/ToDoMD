# ToDoMD

This plugin provides a new kind of todo syntax. For my view on this see [the Manifest](ToDoMD-Manifesto.md).

It supports autocompletion for that syntax. More Features to be introduced over time, see section features.

I am not an experienced JS or TS developer, I only picked up programming in those langauges a few weeks ago (September 2023).
I canibalized a lot of code from the obsidian-compltr plugin: https://github.com/tth05/obsidian-completr
and the obsidian-tasks plugin: https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks.
